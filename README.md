# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements the classic Snake Game using reinforcement learning techniques. The game is built using Python and Pygame library for visualization. Reinforcement learning is employed to train an agent to play the game effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.0
- Pygame
- Keras
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-reinforcement-learning.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd snake-game-reinforcement-learning
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Description

### Game Rules
- The snake starts with a length of one unit.
- The objective is to eat as much food as possible to increase the length of the snake.
- If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen, the game ends.
- The game speed increases as the snake grows longer.

### Reinforcement Learning
- The agent is trained using the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm.
- The state space consists of the positions of the snake's head, the positions of the food, and the direction of movement.
- The action space includes four possible actions: up, down, left, and right.
- The agent receives a reward of +1 for each food eaten and a reward of -1 for each collision.
- The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over multiple episodes.

### Components
- `main.py`: Main script to run the game and train the agent.
- `Agent.py`: Contains the DQN agent class.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for preprocessing game data and visualization.
- `model.h5`: Pre-trained DQN model weights.

### Colab Integration
- The game can be displayed in Google Colab using the provided integration.
- The `google.colab.patches` and `cv2` libraries are used for displaying game frames in Colab.

## Results

- The performance of the trained agent can be evaluated using various metrics such as average score, training time, and convergence plots.
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn can be included to illustrate the training progress and final results.
